I will be following along the Odin Project exercise, 
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project#assignment,
to create an etch-a-sketch webpage. This will test my skills in HTML, CSS, and
Javascript that I have learned in the Odin Project so far.
