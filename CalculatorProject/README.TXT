This is Ethan Newberry and this project is my final Javascript beginner project
for the Odin Project. I created a basic layout of a Calculator in HTML, styled it with CSS, and made
it work with Javascript. The Javascript skills demonstrated in this project 
mainly revolve around: function creation, DOM selection with eventlisteners, 
and DOM reading and changing.
